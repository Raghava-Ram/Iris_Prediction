# Iris_Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts the species of a flower based on its sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width using the classic Iris dataset. The model is built with a Random Forest Classifier, which leverages an ensemble of decision trees to achieve high accuracy and robust performance.
